# FreelancePackageShell
A GUI-frontend for package-management systems, uses a system of plug-in's that are interfaces to package-management systems, it's ment for openSolaris and illumos distros.

RTM package-management systems supported(at version 1x) are:
* IPS
* ~~APT~~
* SRV4-packages
* ZAP
* PkgSrc

If this sounds like packageKit, well i found out that bit after thinking this one up.
It has the requirements of the GTK+ toolkit, Version 2x as a minium.
